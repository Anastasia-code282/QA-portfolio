# Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)

Boundary Value Analysis is a test design technique used to test values at the boundaries of allowed input ranges.

## Example
Field: Age  
Allowed range: from 18 to 65

## Test Values
| Test Case | Input | Expected Result |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| TC-01 | 17 | Access denied |
| TC-02 | 18 | Access granted |
| TC-03 | 19 | Access granted |
| TC-04 | 64 | Access granted |
| TC-05 | 65 | Access granted |
| TC-06 | 66 | Access denied |

## Conclusion
Boundary values often reveal defects that are not found when testing only typical values.
