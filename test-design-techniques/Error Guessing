# Error Guessing

Error Guessing is a technique based on tester experience and intuition to identify areas where defects are likely to occur.

## Example
Search functionality on e-commerce website

## Possible Error Scenarios
- Empty search input
- Input with special characters (!@#$%)
- Very long input string (100+ characters)
- Mixed letters and numbers (abc123)
- Search with unsupported language

## Test Cases
| Test Case | Input                 | Expected Result                 |
|-----------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|
| TC-01     | ""                    | Validation message              |
| TC-02     | "@@@###"              | No results / error message      |
| TC-03     | 100 random characters | System handles input correctly  |
| TC-04     | "brake123"            | Relevant results                |
| TC-05     | Chinese characters    | No results or handled correctly |

## Conclusion
Error guessing helps identify defects that are often missed by formal techniques.
