# State Transition Testing

State Transition Testing is used when the system changes behavior based on its current state.

## Example
User account status

## States
- Active
- Blocked
- Deleted

## Transitions
| Current State |          Action        | New State |
|---------------|------------------------|-----------|
| Active        | Too many failed logins | Blocked   |
| Blocked       | Admin unlocks account  | Active    |
| Active        | User deletes account   | Deleted   |

## Test Scenarios
- Verify login is blocked for blocked user
- Verify deleted user cannot log in
